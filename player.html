            Famous Players

        <p>
            We will introduce 2 famous players. Both of them are very productive when streaming and
            explaining how the games should go and what their stradegies are.
            By the way, they both only speaks Japanese. What?
            It's not my fault for having you only know English.

            Maybe Amemiya Taiyou is too hard core a player for you.
            Then you can check out a more beginner friendly youtuber.

            She is a streamer with a live2d animation avator.
            Besides playing Tetris, she also streams for chating and singing.
