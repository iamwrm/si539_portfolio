        <p>
            The community allows us to support one another, interact, share experiences and our modern life struggles.
            Having this
            open bond with others is what builds valuable relationships, and gives us a deeper sense of belonging.
            Communities are also rich in resources. Your strengths may be someone else's weaknesses and vice versa.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, we may be very strict when when it comes to picking the member of our community. You have to show
            you enthusiasm on Tetris before being allowed to attend any of the events.
            This is a security measure so that you are well prepared for meetups, instead of being
            crushed while competing in the Tetris game by our pre-school aged members.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you still want to give it a shot and join the community, please fill in the form below.
            We may or may not review it and we may or may not welcome you to be a new member of the
            Tetris 99 community.

            As our founder and president says, one can never feel happy before being beaten to nearly
            death. In this journey, you will encounter tears and joys.
            May the T's be with you.
