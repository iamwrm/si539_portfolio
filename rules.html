        <h2>
            Basics
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Block compositions
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are 7 kinds of blocks in the game.
            By conventions, we name them after letters.
            We have O,L,J,S,Z,I blocks.
        </p>

        <div class="blocks_layout">
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/o.png" alt="o">
                <div class="block_text">O block</div>
            </div>
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/l.png" alt="l">
                <div class="block_text">L block</div>
            </div>
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/j.png" alt="j">
                <div class="block_text">J block</div>
            </div>
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/s.png" alt="s">
                <div class="block_text">S block</div>
            </div>
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/z.png" alt="z">
                <div class="block_text">Z block</div>
            </div>
            <div class="block_container"><img src="./images/blocks/i.png" alt="i">
                <div class="block_text">I block</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>

            You job is to stack them. After a line is full of blocks, it will be cleared.
        </p>

        <h3>
            The 'Battle Royale' Twist
        </h3>

        <p>
            In Tetris 99, you'll be playing against 98 other players in real time. Players can attack each other during
            the game, sending 'junk' lines to an opponent's screen, and the last one standing after all the mayhem is
            declared the winner.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a surprising number of things to think about here, such as your attack, defence, and keeping an
            eye on what your opponents are doing. Hopefully, these tips will help you on your way to victory.
        </p>

        <h2>

            Advances
        </h2>

        <h3>
            K.O.s (Right Stick Up)
        </h3>

        <p>

            The K.O.s option targets those who are currently in danger of seeing their blocks reach the top of their
            screen. By targetting these players, you theoretically have a higher chance of immediately claiming a K.O.
            when attacking them with 'junk' lines, gaining at least a portion of a badge in the process for multiplayer
            damage.

            The problem is that, sometimes, a player will be wiped out before your 'junk' line attacks them, meaning you
            don't get the kill or the badge reward. If you're really wanting to go for kills, this isn't a bad way to do
            it, but it can never be 100% reliable.
        </p>


        <h2>
            After the Manual
        </h2>
        <p>
            At this point, you should be able to play the game yourself, but it's far from
            hitting other human player's ass!
            You will need to learn from famous or professional players.
